# Effective Tray for D&D Fifth Edition
A module for dnd5e on foundryvtt that makes the effects tray better.

## What it does 
Allows users to apply active effects to selected tokens from chat cards even if they do not own the actor that made the chat card.
Adds a setting (on by default) that starts the effect tray in its expanded position.

## What it doesn't do
Allow users to apply active effects to targets, or to tokens they do not own.
