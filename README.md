# Effective Tray (for D&D Fifth Edition)
A module for dnd5e on foundryvtt that allows the effects tray to be used more effectively.

## What it does 
Allows users to apply active effects to selected tokens from chat cards even if they do not own the actor that made the chat card.
- Adds a setting (on by default) that starts the effects tray in its expanded position.
- Adds a setting (on by default) that removes 'Apply Effect to Actor' from any effect with a duration when any item with an effect is created (dragged & droppped).
- Adds a setting (off by default) to disable the main function of the module, in order to just use the additional features.

## What it doesn't do
Allow users to apply active effects to targets, or to tokens they do not own.
