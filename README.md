# Effective Tray (for D&D Fifth Edition)
A module for dnd5e on foundryvtt that allows the effects and damage trays to be used more effectively.

## Effects Tray 
Allows users to use the effect tray as much or as little as wanted by the GM, up to and including transferal to targets they do not own. If using this feature (which is on by default), left click to apply effects to selected tokens that the user owns (as the system's default behavior), or right click to apply effects to tokens that the user does not own.
## Damage Tray
Allows users to use the damage tray for selected tokens that they own, and for targeted tokens (either that they own, or ones they don't own with a setting). User ability to use the damage tray is on by default, but unless the relevant setting is selected, they cannot damage targets.

## Settings
- **Transfer to Target**: Allow users to transfer effects to targets with right click (on by default).
- **Legacy Targeting for Effects**: Apply effects to target with right click, rather than the target source control (on by default).
- **Damage Target**: Allow users to damage targets (that they don't own) with the damage tray (off by default).
- **Delete Instead of Refresh**: Attempting to transfer an effect to an actor that has it already will delete it rather than refreshing its duration (off by default).
- **Filtering** based on actor type, permissions, and token disposition. This prevents users from seeing and interacting with effects of certain origins, depending on GM preference (no filtering is performed by default).
- **Use Default Trays**: Adds settings (off by default) to use the default effects and damage trays. Only the features *below* this setting will function if a given tray is in its default mode.
- **Don't Close Trays on Apply**: Don't automatically close trays when hitting submit. Won't work with default effects tray (now off by default).
- **Scroll on Expand**: Scroll chat to bottom when expanding a tray that is at the bottom (experimental, on by default).
- **Remove 'Apply Effect to Actor'**: On the time of creation (i.e. drag & drop), remove 'Apply Effect to Actor' from effects on items that have a duration to allow for normal use of the timer (on by default).
- **Multiple Effects with Concentration**: Allow multiple effects to be applied from spells with concentration (off by default).

## API
Now includes three helper functions exposed in the global scope under `effectiv`, `effectiv.applyEffect`, `effectiv.applyDamage` and `effective.partitionTargets`. These functions *have not been heavily tested* and are included now in the hopes that, if someone wants to use them, they will also test them for issues.

`applyEffect`, a helper function to allow users to apply effects. It allows users to apply effects via macro (or other module), and can take a variety of types of data when doing so, allowing effect data to be passed as the full ActiveEffect document, an effect Uuid, or an object (note that passing it as an object will not interact with refreshing duration or deleting effects of same origin, as determined by module setting, because creating an effect from an object will have its own unique origin). Similarly, this function allows target data to be passed as an array of Uuids, a single Uuid, an array of Tokens, or a Set, as `game.user.targets`.

This helper also allows the use of the other things the effects tray does, primarily flagging effects with spellLevel, or any other arbitrary flags (via effectData), and making an effect dependent on a concentration effect (so it will be deleted when the concentration effect is). If concentration is used, because it passed as an ID, you must also pass the Uuid or Actor document of the actor the concentration effect is on.

```js
/**
 * Helper function to allow for macros or other applications to apply effects to owned and unowned targets.
 * @param {string|object|ActiveEffect5e} effect            The effect to apply.
 * @param {Set<Token5e>|Token5e[]|string[]|string} targets Targeted tokens.
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {object} [options.effectData]                    A generic data object, which typically handles the level the originating spell was cast at, 
 *                                                         if it originated from a spell, if any. Use flags like { "flags.dnd5e.spellLevel": 1 }.
 * @param {string} [options.concentration]                 The ID (not Uuid) of the concentration effect this effect is dependent on, if any.
 * @param {string|Actor5e} [options.caster]                The Uuid or Actor5e document of the actor that cast the spell that requires concentration, if any.

async function applyEffect(
  effect, 
  targets, 
  { effectData: null, concentration: null, caster: null } = {}
)
```
```js
/* in use...*/
effectiv.applyEffect(
  effect, 
  targets, 
  { effectData: null, concentration: null, caster: null } = {}
)
```

`applyDamage`, helper function to allow users to apply damage. This function has been tested not at all and is included as a courtesy. Personally I find the way damage information must be structured to respect resistances, etc is too much of a mess to test this even a single time, but if someone really wants to do this over a socket but didn't write their own socket handler for it...here you go. Full, extensive documentation of the array that must be created is in scripts/api.mjs, copied directly from `dnd5e`, with the exception that socket transmission requires the sets to be arrays. Unlike `applyEffect`, this applies no damage via the requesting client, and so is basically only meant for damaging unowned targets. Users wishing to apply damage to owned targets should simply use the system's `Actor#applyDamage`.
```js
  /**
   * The below documentation is from the system's damage application method, except all Sets are arrays.
   * Please see the system's documentation for a complete understanding of this method, as this helper is only
   * provided as a courtesy.
   * 
   * Description of a source of damage. 
   *
   * @typedef {object} DamageDescription
   * @property {number} value            Amount of damage.
   * @property {string} type             Type of damage.
   * @property {Array<string>} properties  Physical properties that affect damage application.
   * @property {object} [active]
   * @property {number} [active.multiplier]      Final calculated multiplier.
   * @property {boolean} [active.modifications]  Did modification affect this description?
   * @property {boolean} [active.resistance]     Did resistance affect this description?
   * @property {boolean} [active.vulnerability]  Did vulnerability affect this description?
   * @property {boolean} [active.immunity]       Did immunity affect this description?
   */

  /**

   * @property {boolean|Array<string>} [downgrade]  Should this actor's resistances and immunities be downgraded by one

   * @property {number} [multiplier=1]         Amount by which to multiply all damage.
   * @property {object|boolean} [ignore]       Array to `true` to ignore all damage modifiers. If Array to an object, then
   *                                           values can either be `true` to indicate that the all modifications of
   *                                           that type should be ignored, or a Array of specific damage types for which

   * @property {boolean|Array<string>} [ignore.modification]   Should this actor's damage modification be ignored?
   * @property {boolean} [invertHealing=true]  Automatically invert healing types to it heals, rather than damages.
   * @property {"damage"|"healing"} [only]     Apply only damage or healing parts. Untyped rolls will always be applied.

  /**

   */
async function applyDamage(damage = [], opts = {}, id)
```
```js  
/* in use...*/
effectiv.applyDamage(damage = [], opts = {}, id)
```

`partitionTargets`, a function similar to foundry's `Array#partition` but specifically designed to handle `game.user.targets`, a set, or an array of tokens. It sorts them into two arrays, the first array containing tokens that the user owns, and the second array containing those token's `document.uuid`s. This can be useful for determining what information needs to be sent over sockets. I have no idea why anyone would use this function, but here it is.
```js
/**
 * Sort tokens into owned and unowned categories.
 * @param {Set|array} targets The set or array of tokens to be sorted.
 * @returns {array}           An Array of length two, the elements of which are the partitioned pieces of the original.
 */
function partitionTargets(targets)
```
```js
/* in use...*/
effectiv.partitionTargets(targets)
```

## Hooks
Now includes two hooks, `effectiv.preApplyEffect` and `effectiv.applyEffect`. The former allows the data to be modified and explicitly returning `false` will prevent the effect from being applied. The later passes the same (modified in the case of effectData), information in its final state upon application. 

These hooks have not been extensively tested.
```js
/**
 * Hook called before the effect is completed and applied.
 * @param {Actor5e} actor                The actor to create the effect on.
 * @param {ActiveEffect5e} effect        The effect to create.
 * @param {object} effectData            A generic data object that contains spellLevel in a `dnd5e` scoped flag, and whatever else.
 * @param {ActiveEffect5e} concentration The concentration effect on which `effect` is dependent, if it requires concentration.
 */
Hooks.call("effectiv.preApplyEffect", actor, effect, { effectData, concentration });
```
```js
/**
 * Hook called before the effect is completed and applied. Same as above except for effectData.
 * @param {Actor5e} actor                The actor to create the effect on.
 * @param {ActiveEffect5e} effect        The effect to create.
 * @param {object} effectData            The packaged effect immediately before application.
 * @param {ActiveEffect5e} concentration The concentration effect on which `effect` is dependent, if it requires concentration.
 */
Hooks.callAll("effectiv.applyEffect", actor, effect, { effectData, concentration });
```

###### **Technical Details**

**Scope:** Replaces the effects tray in chat messages with a similar one that allows all users, not just GMs or the chat message's creator, to apply active effects to tokens they control (and have selected) by looping over all messages in the "dnd5e.renderChatMessage" hook. Extends the system's damage application element class to allow users who are not GMs to use the damage tray. Additionally, transmits target target and change data via sockets to allow an active GM client to apply effects (or damage) to a non GM user's targets.

**License:** MIT License.

**Additional Info:** Thanks to Zhell for help with adding actors to a set and lots of other stuff (and for the github action), and to Flix for much encouragement. Thanks also to ChaosOS for help with sockets, and DrentalBot for help with suppressing the system's context menu.

Some code has been adapted from [dnd5e](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e), particularly the extension of the damage application custom html element, and unifying module and system logic for collapsing or expanding trays.
